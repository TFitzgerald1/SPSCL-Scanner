# SPSCL-Scanner

WHile attending KSU, one of the required courses taken was a "Concept of Programming Languages". One of the projects in this class was to create a scanner for a custom programming language that the professor made called SPSCL. This program is the final version of this project. The programa analyzes the text for a .scl file and parses it to identify the different lexemes within the code.
